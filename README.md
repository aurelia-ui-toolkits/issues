# issues
This repository's primary purpose is to host the discussions on aurelia-ui-toolkits issues :-)

As this repository contains no code and is focused on mainly generic issues related to all actual repositories:

- https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-kendoui-plugin
- https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-twbootstrap-plugin
- https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-materialize-plugin

this repository does not have any assignable tasks - all such items "live" in one of the above three repositories.

I would like to hear people's opinion on the division of all `aurelia-ui-toolkits` issues in three actual repositories (which contain issues related to that specific repo) and one "dummy" repo that has no code and has only general (specific plugin independent) issues.

No general issue should have actionable tasks - instead it should create a reference to a "subclass" of such task as "projected" on that specific plugin. Ths would ensure the consistency of task assignments across all repositories.

Any comments / improvements?
